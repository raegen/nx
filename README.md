This action provides the means to use [remote cache][remote cache] enabled
[NX][NX] CLI in your GitHub Actions workflows, backed by @actions/cache.

It relies upon and uses the existing NX infrastructure, meaning all the
configuration is done through the normal NX ecosystem. All operations are
cached by default, otherwise respecting the value set for specific target.cache
option.

## Usage

Usage is straight-forward, just use the action as you would use the NX CLI,
through the `nx` input specifying the NX command and arguments to run (with).

```yaml
- uses: raegen/nx
  with:
    nx: run-many --target=build
```

### Inputs

`nx` The NX command and args to run. Defaults to `--help`.

Example(s):

```yaml
 - uses: raegen/nx
      with:
         nx: run-many --target=build # or
         nx: build my-app # or
         nx: affected --target=build # or
         nx: ...
```

`cacheDirectory` Defines where the local cache is stored.
Defaults to `.nx/cache/remote`.

Example(s):

```yaml
 - uses: raegen/nx
   with:
      nx: ...
      cacheDirectory: .nx/cache/remote # or
      cacheDirectory: someotherdir
```

### Cache

First and foremost: this is not, nor is it using nx local cache.
It is not just awkwardly saving/restoring the forever-growing GBs of whatever is
under .nx/cache (prior to 17, it lived in node_modules/.cache/nx).

The action runs nx using a custom runner that implements the nx remote cache
interface, the same way that nx-cloud runner does. This cache is atomic,
done on task level (separately for each project:target:configuration ran as a
result of a command).

There is no additional configuration needed - it works out of the box and is
enabled for every target by default, unless you explicitly set `cache: false`
to target configuration per nx documentation. (obviously, this only applies to
nx commands ran through the action)
